10.1093/epirev/mxt009;24284871;;The Prevalence and Risk Factors of Dysmenorrhea;Dysmenorrhea is a common menstrual complaint with a major impact on women’s quality of life, work productivity, and health-care utilization. A comprehensive review was performed on longitudinal or case-control or crosssectional studies with large community-based samples to accurately determine the prevalence and/or incidence and risk factors of dysmenorrhea. Fifteen primary studies, published between 2002 and 2011, met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of dysmenorrheavaries between 16% and 91% in women of reproductive age, with severe pain in 2%–29% of the women studied. Women’s age, parity, and use of oral contraceptives were inversely associated with dysmenorrhea, and high stress increased the risk of dysmenorrhea. The effect sizes were generally modest to moderate, with odds ratios varying between 1 and 4. Family history of dysmenorrhea strongly increased its risk, with odds ratios between 3.8 and 20.7. Inconclusive evidence was found for modifiable factors such as cigarette smoking, diet, obesity, depression, and abuse. Dysmenorrhea is a significant symptom for a large proportion of women of reproductive age;;;

Through the research process, a dysmenorrheal self-care pamphlet for female adolescents was developed. The study used a quasi-experimental intervention with a nonequivalent-control group design. Three vocational nursing schools were requested to participate in this study: one was assigned to the experimental group and two were assigned to the control group. Female students who had experienced dysmenorrheic cramps two or more times during the last 6 months since the interview were recruited for the study. There were 218 subjects randomly assigned to an experimental group, and 237 subjects to a control group. Intervention consisted of a three-session health education program in which the experimental group was split up into six smaller groups. Data were collected before, 2 weeks after, and 4 months after the intervention. Results revealed a significant increase in the experimental group members' dysmenorrhea-related knowledge and self-care behavior, but not in their attitudes. The findings of this study can serve as a guide to healthcare providers who want to design an effective systematic menstrual health education program for female adolescents.;Miin-Huey Chiou,Hsiu-Hung Wang,Yi-Hsin Yang,Yi-Hsin Yang;Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences;2007

Method: This study was conducted in a pharmaceutical industrial complex in Tehran in 2012. 406 female workers in packaging units were studied on the menstrual cycle characteristics. The studied workers were divided into two groups of shift workers and non-shift workers and were compared in terms of the frequency of menstrual disorder (short-term cycle, long-term cycle, irregular cycle and bleeding during menstrual cycle) as well as hormonal values (FSH, LH, TSH, and Prolactin). Results: The odds ratio (OR) for menstrual disorder in the shift workers was 5.54 (95% CI=2.78-11.02) compared to the non-shift workers. The mean difference of hormonal values (except prolactin) between shift workers and non-shift workers was not significant (P> 0.05). Conclusion: This study suggests that shift work may disrupt the menstrual cycle.;Mirsaeed Attarchi,Hamidreza Darkhi,Mahshad Khodarahmian,Mandana Dolati,Maryam Kashanian,Mostafa Ghaffari,Elham Mirzamohammadi,Saber Mohammadi;Global Journal of Health Science;2013
10.1080/07399330290107449;12418990;;EFFECTS OF SHIFTWORK ON SLEEP AND MENSTRUAL FUNCTION IN NURSES;Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms ( p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep ( p < 0.01) when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.;Susan E. Labyak,Susan Lava,Fred W.

10.1093/humupd/dmv039;26346058;;What we know about primary dysmenorrhea today: a critical review;BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology, is a common, and often debilitating, gynecological condition that affects between 45 and 95% of menstruating women. Despite the high prevalence, dysmenorrhea is often poorly treated, and even disregarded, by health professionals, pain researchers, and the women themselves, who may accept it as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. This review reports on current knowledge, particularly with regards to the impact and consequences of recurrent menstrual pain on pain sensitivity, mood, quality of life and sleep in women with primary dysmenorrhea.  METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches on primary dysmenorrhea were performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. Full-text manuscripts published between the years 1944 and 2015 were reviewed for relevancy and reference lists were cross-checked for additional relevant studies. In combination with the word 'dysmenorrhea' one or more of the following search terms were used to obtain articles published in peer-reviewed journals only: pain, risk factors, etiology, experimental pain, clinical pain, adenomyosis, chronic pain, women, menstrual cycle, hyperalgesia, pain threshold, pain tolerance, pain sensitivity, pain reactivity, pain perception, central sensitization, quality of life, sleep, treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  RESULTS: Women with dysmenorrhea, compared with women without dysmenorrhea, have greater sensitivity to experimental pain both within and outside areas of referred menstrual pain. Importantly, the enhanced pain sensitivity is evident even in phases of the menstrual cycle when women are not experiencing menstrual pain, illustrating that long-term differences in pain perception extend outside of the painful menstruation phase. This enhanced pain sensitivity may increase susceptibility to other chronic pain conditions in later life;;;
10.1002/nur.21726;27177093;;Beliefs About Dysmenorrhea and Their Relationship to Self-Management.;Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent and is the leading cause of work and school absences among women of reproductive age. However, self-management of dysmenorrhea is not well understood in the US, and little evidence is available on factors that influence dysmenorrhea self-management. Guided by the Common Sense Model, we examined women's representations of dysmenorrhea (beliefs about causes, symptoms, consequences, timeline, controllability, coherence, and emotional responses), described their dysmenorrhea self-management behaviors, and investigated the relationship between representations and self-management behaviors. We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 762 adult women who had dysmenorrhea symptoms in the last six months. Participants had varied beliefs about the causes of their dysmenorrhea symptoms, which were perceived as a normal part of life. Dysmenorrhea symptoms were reported as moderately severe, with consequences that moderately affected daily life. Women believed they understood their symptoms moderately well and perceived them as moderately controllable but them to continue through menopause. Most women did not seek professional care but rather used a variety of pharmacologic and complementary health approaches. Care-seeking and use of self-management strategies were associated with common sense beliefs about dysmenorrhea cause, consequences, timeline, and controllability. The findings may inform development and testing of self-management interventions that address dysmenorrhea representations and facilitate evidence-based management. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;Chen X.

10.1371/journal.pmed.1002803;;;Women’s and girls’ experiences of menstruation in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and qualitative metasynthesis;Background Attention to women’s and girls’ menstrual needs is critical for global health and gender equality. The importance of this neglected experience has been elucidated by a growing body of qualitative research, which we systematically reviewed and synthesised.   Methods and findings We undertook systematic searching to identify qualitative studies of women’s and girls’ experiences of menstruation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Of 6,892 citations screened, 76 studies reported in 87 citations were included. Studies captured the experiences of over 6,000 participants from 35 countries. This included 45 studies from sub-Saharan Africa (with the greatest number of studies from Kenya [n = 7], Uganda [n = 6], and Ethiopia [n = 5]), 21 from South Asia (including India [n = 12] and Nepal [n = 5]), 8 from East Asia and the Pacific, 5 from Latin America and the Caribbean, 5 from the Middle East and North Africa, and 1 study from Europe and Central Asia. Through synthesis, we identified overarching themes and their relationships to develop a directional model of menstrual experience. This model maps distal and proximal antecedents of menstrual experience through to the impacts of this experience on health and well-being. The sociocultural context, including menstrual stigma and gender norms, influenced experiences by limiting knowledge about menstruation, limiting social support, and shaping internalised and externally enforced behavioural expectations. Resource limitations underlay inadequate physical infrastructure to support menstruation, as well as an economic environment restricting access to affordable menstrual materials. Menstrual experience included multiple themes: menstrual practices, perceptions of practices and environments, confidence, shame and distress, and containment of bleeding and odour. These components of experience were interlinked and contributed to negative impacts on women’s and girls’ lives. Impacts included harms to physical and psychological health as well as education and social engagement. Our review is limited by the available studies. Study quality was varied, with 18 studies rated as high, 35 medium, and 23 low trustworthiness. Sampling and analysis tended to be untrustworthy in lower-quality studies. Studies focused on the experiences of adolescent girls were most strongly represented, and we achieved early saturation for this group. Reflecting the focus of menstrual health research globally, there was an absence of studies focused on adult women and those from certain geographical areas.   Conclusions Through synthesis of extant qualitative studies of menstrual experience, we highlight consistent challenges and developed an integrated model of menstrual experience. This model hypothesises directional pathways that could be tested by future studies and may serve as a framework for program and policy development by highlighting critical antecedents and pathways through which interventions could improve women’s and girls’ health and well-being.

Studies have shown that women are more likely to have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and more women seek healthcare because of IBS than men. Aim. We wanted to examine the natural history of IBS and dysmenorrhea in women over a 10-year period and to assess the change in IBS after menopause. Method. A population-based postal study. A questionnaire was mailed to the same age- and gender-stratified random sample of the Icelandic population aged 18–75 in 1996 and again in 2006. Results. 77% premenopausal women had dysmenorrhea in the year 1996 and 74% in 2006. 42% of women with dysmenorrhea had IBS according to Manning criteria in the year 2006 and 49% in 1996. 26% of women with dysmenorrhea had IBS according to Rome III 2006 and 11% in the year 1996. In 2006 30% women had severe or very severe dysmenorrhea pain severity. More women (27%) reported severe abdominal pain after menopause than before menopause 11%. Women without dysmenorrhea were twice more likely to remain asymptomatic than the women with dysmenorrhea. Women with dysmenorrhea were more likely to have stable symptoms and were twice more likely to have increased symptoms. Conclusion. Women with IBS are more likely to experience dysmenorrhea than women without IBS which seems to be a part of the symptomatology in most women with IBS. IBS symptom severity seems to increase after menopause.;Linda Bjork Olafsdottir,H. Gudjonsson,Heidur Hrund Jonsdottir,Einar Bjornsson,Bjarni Thjodleifsson;Gastroenterology Research and Practice;2012

A convenience sampling method was used. Freshmen from three vocational nursing schools located in southern Taiwan were recruited. 805 potential participants were surveyed with structured questionnaires, and 760 valid questionnaires were obtained. Results showed the average age of the participants to be 16.7 years. The prevalence rate of dysmenorrhea was 73.3%. Fifty percent of participants reported their menarche occurred between the ages of 12 to 14, 61.6% of them still didn't have regular menstruation, 83.9% had menstruation periods that lasted between 4 to 6 days, 34.6% had received relevant health education, and 20.8% had visited a doctor for dysmenorrhea. There was a significant difference between the dysmenorrhea and non-dysmenorrhea groups in terms of menstrual regularity and receipt of health education. Based on research results, we suggest improving female adolescents' self-care behavior against dysmenorrhea through enhanced health education in schools.;Miin-Huey Chiou,Hsiu-Hung Wang;Journal of Nursing Research;2008

10.1539/joh.47.149;15824480;;The associations between menstrual function and life style/working conditions among nurses in Taiwan.;This study was aimed at understanding the relationship among menstrual pattern, dysmenorrhea, life style and working conditions in nurses. The nurses were randomly selected from a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Each subject completed daily records including life and working conditions during the study period. The study showed that there were statistically significant differences in work years, daily working hours and type of work shift among nurses that worked at different units in the hospital. In the perceived regular cycle group, nurses that worked the night shift only exhibited the shortest menstrual cycles, less than 25 d. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) among the nurses' menstrual cycles. Many life factors (such as passive tobacco smoke exposure, perceived life satisfaction and perceived life stress) and working factors (such as work years, perceived work satisfaction and perceived work stress) were not significantly related to menstrual cycle regularity. In addition, 30% of the nurses complained of dysmenorrhea. Some factors including age, marital status and perceived life satisfaction were significantly related to dysmenorrhea. However, other life factors (such as passive tobacco smoke exposure, smoking, coffee, alcohol, cold drink habits, exercise and perceived life stress) and working factors (such as working places, type of work shift, daily work hours, perceived work satisfaction and perceived work stress) showed no correlation with dysmenorrhea. This study indicates that women should pay attention to their menstrual function and dysmenorrhea phenomenon.;Fen-Fang Chung,Chuan-Chiang Chou Yao,Gwo-Hwa Wan;Journal of Occupational Health;2005

10.1007/s11199-011-0052-z;;;The Menstrual Mark: Menstruation as Social Stigma;In this theoretical paper, we argue that menstruation is a source of social stigma for women. The word stigma refers to any stain or mark that renders the individual’s body or character defective. This stigma is transmitted through powerful socialization agents in popular culture such as advertisements and educational materials. We demonstrate, in our review of the psychological literature concerning attitudes and experiences of predominantly American girls and women, that the stigmatized status of menstruation has important consequences for their health, sexuality, and well-being. We argue that the stigma of menstruation both reflects and contributes to women’s lower social status and conclude with suggestions for ways to resist the stigma.;Ingrid Johnston-Robledo,Ingrid Johnston-Robledo,Ingrid Johnston-Robledo,Joan C.

Despite the association between stress and pregnancy outcomes, few studies have examined the possible link between stress and dysmenorrhoea. Aims and Methods: Using a population based cohort of Chinese women, the independent effect of women's perceived stress in the preceding menstrual cycle on the incidence of dysmenorrhoea in the subsequent cycle was investigated prospectively. The analysis included 1160 prospectively observed menstrual cycles from 388 healthy, nulliparous, newly married women who intended to conceive. The perception of stress and the occurrence of dysmenorrhoea in each menstrual cycle were determined from daily diaries recorded by the women. Results: After adjustment for important covariates, the risk of dysmenorrhoea was more than twice as great among women with high stress compared to those with low stress in the preceding cycle (OR = 2.4;;;
10.1186/1472-698x-11-7;21679414;;'The girl with her period is the one to hang her head' Reflections on menstrual management among schoolgirls in rural Kenya;The onset of menstruation is a landmark event in the life of a young woman. Yet the complications and challenges that can accompany such an event have been understudied, specifically in resource-poor settings. As interventions aim to improve female attendance in schools, it is important to explore how menstruation is perceived and navigated by girls in the school setting. This research conveys rural Kenyan schoolgirls' perceptions and practices related to menstruation Data were collected at six rural schools in the Nyanza Province of Western Kenya. Using focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and field notes from observations, researchers collected information from 48 primary schoolgirls and nine teachers. Systematic analysis began with a reading of transcripts and debriefing notes, followed by manual coding of the narratives. Focus group discussions became opportunities for girls to share thoughts on menstruation, instruct one another on management practices and advise one another on coping mechanisms. Girls expressed fear, shame, distraction and confusion as feelings associated with menstruation. These feelings are largely linked to a sense of embarrassment, concerns about being stigmatized by fellow students and, as teachers explained, a perception that the onset of menstruation signals the advent of a girl's sexual status. Among the many methods for managing their periods, girls most frequently said they folded, bunched up or sewed cloth, including cloth from shirts or dresses, scraps of old cloth, or strips of an old blanket. Cloth was reported to frequently leak and cause chafing, which made school attendance difficult particularly as the day progressed. Attitudes and practices of girls toward menstruation have been arranged into personal, environmental and behavioural factors. Further research on menstrual management options that are practical, sustainable and culturally acceptable must be conducted to inform future programs and policies that aim to empower young girls as they transition into womanhood. Stakeholders working within this and similar contexts must consider systematic mechanisms to explain to young girls what menstruation is and how to manage it. Providing sanitary supplies or guiding girls on how to create supplies serve as critical components for future interventions.;Shannon A. McMahon,Peter John Winch,Bethany A.

This study explores the menstrual hygiene practices and knowledge of girls at rural government primary schools in the Rukungiri district in Uganda and assesses the extent to which poor menstrual hygiene management (MHM) affects their education. METHODS: a self-administered questionnaire was completed by schoolgirls in six government-run primary schools in the Rukungiri district. Focus groups were held with girls from each school and semi-structured interviews were conducted with headteachers and female teachers from the participating schools. A toilet assessment was also conducted in each school. RESULTS: one hundred and forty schoolgirls completed the questionnaire. The girls reported a lack of access to adequate resources, facilities and accurate information to manage their menstrual hygiene effectively at school. They reported that, as a result, during menstruation they often struggle at school or miss school. Eighty-six girls (61.7%) reported missing school each month for menstrual-related reasons (mean 1.64, range 0-10, SD. 1.84).  CONCLUSION: it is common for girls who attend government-run primary schools in the Rukungiri district to miss school or struggle in lessons during menstruation because they do not have access to the resources, facilities, or information they need to manage for effective MHM. This is likely to have detrimental effects on their education and future prospects. A large-scale study is needed to explore the extent of this issue.;Robyn Boosey,Georgina Prestwich,Toity Deave,Toity Deave;The Pan African medical journal;2014

Aside from a deleterious effect on the individual's private life, menstrual disorders are being increasingly recognized as having significant implications at work. This is particularly relevant in occupations such as nursing, where the majority of staff is female. Various investigations have identified the prevalence, distribution, and risk factors associated with menstrual disorders, both in the general community and within the nursing profession. Overall, it is clear that menstrual disorders and their adverse symptoms represent an important occupational health challenge for modern nursing. Future interventions specifically aimed at reducing the work-related burden of these issues should be urgently considered. A more dedicated commitment from higher management regarding the overall health of nurses at work is also required.;Derek R. Smith;Nursing & Health Sciences;2008

Little research has been conducted on how menstruation affects school absence. This study examines the association of menstrual hygiene management knowledge, facilities and practice with absence from school during menstruation among Bangladeshi schoolgirls.  Methods  We conducted a nationally representative, cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi schools from March to June 2013 among girls 11 to 17years old who reached menarche. We sampled 700 schools from 50 urban and 50 rural clusters using a probability proportional to size technique. We interviewed 2332 schoolgirls and conducted spot checks in each school for menstrual hygiene facilities. To assess factors associated with reported school absence, we estimated adjusted prevalence difference (APD) for controlling confounders’ effect using generalised estimating equations to account for school-level clustering.

10.3390/diseases7010005;;;Prevalence, Wellbeing, and Symptoms of Dysmenorrhea among University Nursing Students in Greece.;Dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) is one of the most common medical conditions among women of reproductive age. Dysmenorrhea has been studied around the world but not yet in Greece. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of dysmenorrhea on the wellbeing (exercising, and social and academic functioning) among nursing students in Greece. A cross-sectional study of 637 nursing students was conducted by administering a questionnaire at a university in Athens. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 89.2% and the rate of severe intensity was 52.5%. Factors that were associated with severe dysmenorrhea were family history (p = 0.02), early menarche (p = 0.05) and menstruation duration (p = 0.05). Women with moderate and severe pain reported using pain relievers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol etc., p < 0.0005). Finally, activities affected by severe pain were class attendance (p = 0.01), personal studying (p < 0.0005), exercising (p < 0.0005), and socializing (p < 0.0005).

Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures  The randomized controlled, prospective, and experimental study was carried out in a nursing school using a pretest-posttest design. Six hundred eighty-two female nursing students, 584 volunteers, from the 2017-2018 academic year participated in the study conducted for the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea (94.0%).  Study subjects were first year female nursing students who scored severe on a Visual Analog Scale for primary dysmenorrhea. As a result of the analysis, 80 female nursing students were assigned to study and control groups. Sixty students, 29 in the study group and 31 in the control group, completed the study. The study group was included in a six-session cognitive-behavioral approach in a dysmenorrhea support program. No intervention was administered to the control group. The control group and the study group were followed by using data collection forms during three menstrual cycles.    Results  In the case of primary dysmenorrhea, the use of nonpharmacological methods was higher in the study group than in the control group. In the third cycle, while the rate of analgesics use was 20.7% in the study group, it was 50% in the control group. Primary dysmenorrhea symptoms, pain levels, and analgesic use decreased. No change was observed in the attitude toward menstruation.    Conclusion  A cost-effective and reliable cognitive behavioral approach-based dysmenorrhea support program can be used to relieve symptoms, decrease the use of analgesics and increase knowledge about primary dysmenorrhea.;Büşra Yilmaz,Busra Yilmaz,Nevin Hotun Sahin;Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology;2019
10.3390/ijerph17186670;32933209;;Living with Pain and Looking for a Safe Environment: A Qualitative Study among Nursing Students with Dysmenorrhea.;Dysmenorrhea refers to chronic pain associated with menstruation that is often accompanied by other symptoms. Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) occurs without any associated pelvic disease. Nonetheless, it may negatively affect women’s quality of life. Among university students, dysmenorrhea decreases academic performance and is a cause of absenteeism. The purposes of our study were to describe how nursing students experienced PD and the changes affecting their body and mood. A qualitative case study was performed among 33 nursing students with PD. Data were collected through five focus groups (with two sessions each) and 10 researchers’ field notes. We used a video meeting platform to conduct the focus groups. A thematic analysis was performed, and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines were followed. Three main themes emerged from the data: (a) living with dysmenorrhea, with two subthemes: menstruation and pain;;;

To enable more synergistic and sustained progress on addressing menstruation-related needs while in school, an effort was undertaken in 2014 to map out a vision, priorities, and a ten-year agenda for transforming girls' experiences, referred to as Menstrual Hygiene Management in Ten (MHM in Ten). The overarching vision is that girls have the information, support, and enabling school environment for managing menstruation with dignity, safety and comfort by 2024. This requires improved research evidence and translation for impactful national level policies. As 2019 marked the midway point, we assessed progress made on the five key priorities, and remaining work to be done, through global outreach to the growing network of academics, non-governmental organizations, advocates, social entrepreneurs, United Nations agencies, donors, and national governments. This paper delineates the key insights to inform and support the growing MHM commitment globally to maximize progress to reach our vision by 2024. Corresponding to the five priorities, we found that (priority 1) the evidence base for MHM in schools has strengthened considerably, (priority 2) global guidelines for MHM in schools have yet to be created, and (priority 3) numerous evidence-based advocacy platforms have emerged to support MHM efforts. We also identified (priority 4) a growing engagement, responsibility, and ownership of MHM in schools among governments globally, and that although MHM is beginning to be integrated into country-level education systems (priority 5), resources are lacking. Overall, progress is being made against identified priorities. We provide recommendations for advancing the MHM in Ten agenda. This includes continued building of the evidence, and expanding the number of countries with national level policies and the requisite funding and capacity to truly transform schools for all students and teachers who menstruate.;Marni Sommer,Bethany A.

10.1002/14651858.cd002248.pub3;17636702;;Behavioural interventions for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea;Background: Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a common gynaecological condition with considerable morbidity. The behavioural approach assumes that psychological and environmental factors interact with, and influence, physiological processes. Behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea may include both physical and cognitive procedures and focus on both physical and psychological coping strategies for dysmenorrhoeic symptoms rather than modification of any underlying organic pathology. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of any behavioural interventions for the treatment of primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatments for example non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched April 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), Social Sciences Index (1980 to April 2005), PsycINFO (1972 to April 2005) and CINAHL (1982 to April 2005) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing behavioural interventions with placebo or other interventions in women with dysmenorrhoea. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: Five trials involving 213 women were included. Behavioural intervention vs control: One trial of pain management training reported reduction in pain and symptoms compared to a control. Three trials of relaxation compared to control reported varied results, two trials showed no difference in symptom severity scores however one trial reported relaxation was effective for reducing symptoms in menstrual sufferers with spasmodic symptoms. Two trials reported less restriction in daily activities following treatment with either relaxation of pain management training compared to a control. One trial also reported less time absent from school following treatment wit pain management training compared to a control. Behavioural intervention vs other behavioural interventions: Three trials showed no difference between behavioural interventions for the outcome of improvement in symptoms. One trial showed that relaxation resulted in a decrease in the need for resting time compared to the relaxation and imagery. Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective for dysmenorrhoea however results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poormethodological quality and age of the trials.;Michelle Proctor,Patricia Aikins Murphy,Helen M Pattison,Jane A Suckling,Cindy Farquhar;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews;2007

This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea and to determine the factors associated with its intensity. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 311 undergraduate female students aged 18 to 27 years in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Socio-demographic characteristics and menstrual factors were obtained through interviews with the help of a pretested questionnaire. The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea was 89.1%. Residing at home, younger age, lower number of years of formal education for the mother, positive family history of dysmenorrhea, higher severity of bleeding, and shorter menstrual period intervals were significantly associated with the higher intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is a common health concern among young women. Being aware of the factors that are associated with its intensity makes it possible for health professionals to organize better focused programs to reduce the adverse effects of dysmenorrhea.;Nahal Habibi,Mary Soo Lee Huang,Wan Ying Gan,Rejali Zulida,Sayyed Morteza Safavi;Pain Management Nursing;2015

It has psychosocial effects on the sufferer and her interactions with others during such periods. In Nigeria, menstrual disorder has received little research attention especially in the public health agenda. This study combines quantitative and qualitative approaches in investigating the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia and their psychosocial effects by focusing on the daily activities of female undergraduates at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select 415 female undergraduates at the University. A snowball sampling technique was used in selecting 37 informants for the in-depth interviews. Results showed a high prevalence of dysmenorrhoea (64%) among respondents within 3 months prior to this study. Dysmenorrhoea was significant among female students who reported dizziness, headache, depression and irritation;;;

The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 53.3% and most students experienced pain at onset of menses. About half of the students reported that menstrual pain interferes with their normal daily activity. The independent predictors of dysmenorhea were longer days of menstrual flow, younger age at menarche and lower scores on extraversion scale. College health-care providers should screen routinely for dysmenorrhea among students and offer treatment. As dysmenorrhea reportedly affects school performance and attendance, more attention should be devoted to providing health education on this topic to students.;Olabisi M. Loto,Tomi A.

Our aim was to describe women's experiences of menstruation across the lifespan. Qualitative interviews with a narrative approach were conducted with 12 women between 18 and 48years of age in Sweden. Using thematic analysis, we found menstruation to be a complex phenomenon that binds women together. It is perceived as an intimate and private matter, which makes women want to conceal the occurrence of menstrual bleeding. Over time, menstruation becomes a natural part of women's lives and gender identity.

Design  The study adopted a qualitative exploratory approach using a descriptive phenomenology to explore the phenomenon of interest.    Setting  The study was conducted in two educational institutions in Accra, Ghana: a Senior High School (SHS) and a University.    Participants and Data Collection  Sixteen participants were purposively recruited (8 SHS and 8 University students) through snowball sampling. Individual interviews were conducted in English, audio-taped, transcribed and analysed using content analysis procedures. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and rigor was ensured through prolonged engagement and member checking.    Results  Participants employed both pharmacologic (orthodox and herbal) and nonpharmacologic approaches such as warm compress, exercise, and water and diet therapy for their dysmenorrhea. Students' dysmenorrhea was managed at the school clinic and the hospital. Health professionals demonstrated negative attitudes towards dysmenorrhea management. Students coped with dysmenorrhea by planning activities before the onset of pain, receiving social and spiritual support, and developing a mind-set to bear pain.    Conclusions  Individualized approaches should be employed to enhance dysmenorrhea management. Health professionals should be educated on dysmenorrhea to improve their attitude and skills for dysmenorrhea management.;Lydia Aziato,Florence Dedey,Joe Nat Clegg-Lamptey;Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology;2015
